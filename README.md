Emotional Support Feature: While helping students manage their study time, the Emotional Support feature (Heart Treehole) provides students with a channel for emotional support and psychological counseling, a feature that is currently lacking in most learning apps.

Customized Study Plans: Users can create daily study plans based on their individual needs. With system reminders and supervision features, they can gradually develop good study habits.
